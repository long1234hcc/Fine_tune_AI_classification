# Fine-Tuned AI Model for Product Brand Recognition
## Project Purpose: Develop a fine-tuned AI model to predict product brands based on product names using deep learning and vector embeddings. The project leverages Hugging Face models for text embeddings and trains a PyTorch-based neural network for brand classification.

## Project Description
1.Data Preparation & Cleaning:
  + Collect and preprocess product data.
  + Normalize and clean text for consistency.
    
2. Embedding Generation:
  + Use Hugging Face pre-trained models to generate vector representations of product names.
    
3. Deep Learning Model Development:
  + Design and implement a neural network architecture using PyTorch.
  + Optimize model structure for brand classification.
    
4. Model Training:
  + Train the deep learning model using processed embeddings.
  + Apply batch processing, regularization, and optimization techniques for improved performance.
    
5. Brand Prediction:
  + Use the trained model to classify product names into brand categories.
    Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

## Project Operation Steps
1. Prepare and clean training data.
2. Generate product name embeddings using Hugging Face models.
3. Build and configure a PyTorch-based deep learning model.
4. Train the model on labeled product data.
5. Use the trained model to predict product brands.
